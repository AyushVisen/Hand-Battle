# Hand Battle
This is a test submission for Stellar Play
Game rules
- Tap Play in Menu screen
- Choose a hand element of your choice(if you win continuosly you will form a streak)
- Try to beat your previous streak every time
- You can switch ON/OFF the music and sfx separately in the Menu screen
- Inside project if you want to add or remove a Hand element just add or remove the enum for it
- if you are adding a enum you have to set it up inside Rules Scriptable object asset
- You also have to modify the ELement Database Scriptable object asset, you have to set up values and references of related asset for that element

# One fun Idea for its meta is
- Give player option in the menu to take only 25 card of his choice
- Both the player will thus have same number of cards but type would vary
- You have to take atleast one card from each type
- Then the fun part will be "Player has to keep count of his card and opponent's card as well
- In the end Player with most round wins will win the match
